However, this info seems to be in discrepancy to the 3C certification that the phone cleared on June 28.   According to the 3C listing, the phone has is very much alive and kicking and more importantly, reveals a juicy detail about the battery. And by juicy, we mean juicy - 6,800 mAh unit is supposed to power up the device. A battery with such charge is comparable to the batteries in some big tablets. There\'s also a photo of it on the Safety Korea website.</message></messageset></messages>
